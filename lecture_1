SET TERMINOLOGY AND NOTATION:
A set is an unordered collection of objects. Example: (X, E, S)

A ⊆ B. This reads as A is a subset of B. This means that A and B are sets,
and every element of A is also an element of B.

A = B. Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements.
(There is no order among elements of a set).

A convenient way to prove that A and B are equal is to prove that each is a
subset of the other. The proof often consists of two parts:
    1. a proof that A ⊆ B
    2. a proof that B ⊆ A

SET EXPRESSIONS:
{ x ∈ R : x >= 0}
The above is read as: "The set consisting of all elements x of the set of real
numbers such that x is greater than or equal to 0." The colon here stands for
"such that."

There are two parts to the set expression:
The part before the colon specifies where the elements of the set come from,
and introduces a variable or variables that can be used in the second part. In
this example, the R indicates that X belongs to real numbers.


The part after the colon:
This gives a rule that restricts which elements specified in the first part
actually get to make it into the set. There are two parts to this set expression.
The part before the colon.

The analogous Python expression is a set comprehension:
>>> S = { -4, 4, -3, -2, 2, -1, 1, 0}
>>> {x for x in S if x >= 0}

The python set comprehensions pretty closely match the mathematical notation.

SET EXPRESSIONS - CONVENTION
So, in math:

      { x ∈ R : x >= 0 }

But often, we leave out the "∈ R" part of it, with the context implied.
It is considered clear what set of values x takes on.

      {x : x >= 0}


x: x² - 5/6x + 1/6 = 0 }

This is the set of all X such that this equation holds, and it only has
these two solutions: 1/2 and (something else I could not see on lecture slide.)

SET TERMINOLOGY AND NOTATION
Cardinality: If a set is finite, we use vertical bars to indicate how many
elements it has. For example, set {A, O, 8, I} has cardinality of 4.
It would be |4|.

Cartesian Product
A x B is the set of all pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. For example:

      for A = {1, 2} and B = {w, x, y, z}, A x B is
      {{1, w}, {2, w}, {1, x}, {2, x}, {1, y}, {2, y}, {1, z}, {2, z}}

So this has a cartesian product of 8. You basically multiply the cardinality of
one set by the cardinality of another.

If A and B are finite sets, then |A x B| = |A| x |B|.
